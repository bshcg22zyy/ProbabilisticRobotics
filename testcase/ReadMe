===MAPS===
line 1: an integer N, the number of features in the map
line 2 ~ N + 1:
    for line k, there would be three numbers x_k, y_k and s_k, which describes the location and signature of feature k
    s_k must be an unique integer within [0, N - 1]


===ROBOTS===
Part 1: translational noise of robot motion
An integer N_tn, number of noise components.
The next N_tn lines, one for each noise component.
First number is weight.
Second number indicate noise type. 0 for Gaussian and 1 for uniform
The rest of the line: parameters for the noise type

Part 2: rotational noise of robot motion. Similar to part 1

Part 3: two numbers representing the distance ranges for the sensor

Part 4: distance noise for the sensor. Similar to part 1

Part 5: two numbers representing the angle ranges for the sensor

Part 6: angle noise for the sensor. Similar to part 1

===ACTION HISTORY===
line 1: three numbers x, y and theta, the initial pose of the robot
line 2: an integer T, number of steps in the history
line 3 ~ T + 2:
    for line k, there are three numbers t_k, v_k and w_k representing the timestamp of action k, and the linear and angular velocities
    the action would last until the timestamp of the next entry
