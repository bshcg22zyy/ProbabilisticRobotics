===MAPS===
line 1: an integer N, the number of features in the map
line 2 ~ N + 1:
    there are three numbers x_k, y_k and s_k for each line that describe the
    location and signature of feature k.
    s_k must be an unique integer within [0, N - 1]. usually s_k == k.


===ROBOTS===
Part 1: translational noise of robot motion.
    An integer N_tn, number of noise components.
    The next N_tn lines,
        each line describe a noise component.
        the first number is the relative weight.
        the second number indicates noise type. 0 for Gaussian and 1 for uniform.
        from the third to the last: parameters for the corresponding noise type.

Part 2: rotational noise of robot motion. Similar to part 1

Part 3: two numbers representing the distance ranges for the sensor.
        for a sensor without any ditance range limit, put two equal numbers.

Part 4: distance noise for the sensor. Similar to part 1

Part 5: two numbers representing the angle ranges for the sensor.
        for a sensor without any angle range limit, put two equal numbers.

Part 6: angle noise for the sensor. Similar to part 1

===ACTION HISTORIES===
line 1: an integer T, number of steps in the history
line 2 ~ T + 1:
    there are three numbers t_k, v_k and w_k for each line that describe the
    timestamp, The linear and the angular velocities of the k-th action.
    the action is active until the time specified (INCLUSIVE).
